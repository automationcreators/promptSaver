**Title:** "Chrome Extension Architecture: 4 Problems Solved | Building Tools with Claude Code"

**Description:**
```
You've seen the 7 mistakes (Video 1) and the real journey (Video 2). Now: the architecture that makes it all possible.

Building production software is 50% architecture, 50% execution. Get the architecture wrong, and execution is impossible. Get it right, and execution becomes obvious.

In this video, I break down the 4 architectural problems that stop most developers—and the exact solutions that make them simple:

**Problem 1 (1:00):** Content Script Isolation
- Why it exists
- How message passing solves it
- Code examples

**Problem 2 (4:00):** Type Safety Across Contexts
- Why it matters
- How TypeScript prevents cascading failures
- Building a message contract

**Problem 3 (7:00):** State Management
- Single source of truth (IndexedDB)
- Reads vs. writes
- Preventing conflicts

**Problem 4 (10:00):** The Workflow That Prevents Mistakes
- The 5-step sequence (Explore → Plan → Implement → Test → Commit)
- When to use each Claude Code agent
- Custom slash commands
- Todo lists as thinking tools

## Final Notes

### Pacing Considerations

- One video per week is sustainable
- Allows time to edit, promote, monitor
- Gives audience time to consume and share
- Builds anticipation for next video

### Quality Standards

All three videos should:
- Have clear, readable code
- Include working examples
- Show actual results
- Maintain consistent branding
- Include proper audio/video production

### Authenticity

The strength of this series is:
- Real journey, not scripted perfection
- Actual problems and solutions
- Your voice, not generic tutorial voice
- Learnings from real experience

Maintain this authenticity in:
- Script delivery (conversational, not robotic)
- Showing mistakes (not just successes)
- Being honest about tradeoffs
- Admitting what you don't know
