# PromptSaver Demo Guide

## 5-Minute Demo: Building a Chrome Extension with Claude Code

Perfect for presentations, pitches, or quick demonstrations of AI-assisted development.

---

## Slide 1: The Challenge (30 seconds)

**"I use AI tools daily but keep retyping the same prompts..."**

- Claude.ai for coding
- ChatGPT for writing
- Gemini for research
- Different interfaces, no unified prompt management
- **Problem:** No easy way to save and reuse prompts across platforms

---

## Slide 2: The Solution (30 seconds)

**"What if I could build a Chrome extension in hours, not weeks?"**

- **PromptSaver** - Universal prompt manager
- Works on 6 AI platforms
- Quick Command with `;;` trigger
- Google Sheets backup
- **Built with Claude Code** - AI pair programmer

---

## Slide 3: Live Demo - The Build Process (2 minutes)

### Part 1: Starting the Project (20 seconds)

**Show Claude Code conversation:**
```
Me: "I want to build a Chrome extension that saves prompts
from AI chat interfaces. What tech stack?"

Claude Code: [Suggests React, TypeScript, IndexedDB, Vite]

Me: "Perfect! Create the initial project structure."

[Claude Code generates entire project structure in seconds]
```

### Part 2: Platform Detection (40 seconds)

**Show Claude Code figuring out selectors:**
```
Me: "Create platform detection for Claude, ChatGPT,
Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, and Meta AI."

Claude Code: [Researches each platform's DOM structure]
[Creates configuration with all selectors]
[Builds detection system]

Me: "The button isn't showing on Gemini."

Claude Code: [Debugs DOM structure]
[Fixes positioning for Gemini's custom UI]
```

**Key Point:** *Claude Code handles the tedious research and debugging*

### Part 3: The Quick Command Feature (40 seconds)

**Show design decision-making:**
```
Me: "Users should type a symbol to access prompts.
What symbol has low conflict with normal typing?"

Claude Code: [Analyzes options: /, \, ;;, ::, etc.]
[Recommends ;; with reasoning]

Me: "Great! Implement it with direct lookup and fuzzy matching."

[Claude Code builds entire Quick Command system]
```

**Key Point:** *AI helps make smart design decisions*

### Part 4: Documentation & Publishing (20 seconds)

**Show automated documentation:**
```
Me: "Generate comprehensive documentation and
prepare for GitHub release."

[Claude Code creates:]
- README.md
- USER_GUIDE.md
- SECURITY.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- Release checklist
```

## Demo Script (Detailed)

### Opening (30 sec)

> "I'm going to show you how I built a production-ready Chrome extension in 6 hours using AI pair programming. This extension works across 6 different AI platforms - Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, and Meta AI - and includes advanced features like quick command access and Google Sheets backup."

### Problem Setup (30 sec)

> "Like many of you, I use multiple AI tools daily. But I was constantly retyping the same prompts. I needed a way to save and reuse prompts across all these different platforms. So I decided to build an extension - but I wanted to see how fast I could do it with Claude Code as my AI pair programmer."

### Demo: The Build Process (2 min)

**[Screen: Claude Code conversation]**

> "I started by just describing what I wanted to build. Claude Code immediately suggested the right tech stack - React, TypeScript, IndexedDB for local storage, and Vite for building."

**[Show: Project structure appears]**

> "Within seconds, it generated the entire project structure. But here's where it gets interesting..."

**[Screen: Platform detection conversation]**

> "Each AI platform has a completely different DOM structure. I needed to find the right CSS selectors for input fields on Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, and Meta AI. Normally, this would take hours of manual inspection."

**[Show: Claude Code generating platform configs]**

> "Claude Code researched each platform and generated the configuration automatically. When the button didn't show up correctly on Gemini, I just told it 'The button isn't visible on Gemini' - and it debugged the issue and fixed the positioning."

**[Screen: Quick Command feature discussion]**

> "Here's my favorite part. I wanted users to quickly access prompts by typing a symbol. I asked Claude Code: 'What symbol would have low conflict?' It analyzed options and recommended double semicolon - ;;. Then it implemented the entire Quick Command system with fuzzy matching and direct lookup."

**[Screen: Documentation generation]**

> "When I was ready to publish, Claude Code generated all the documentation - README, user guide, security policy, changelog - formatted professionally and ready to go."

### Demo: The Final Product (1 min)

**[Screen: Chrome with extension]**

> "Here's the result. Watch what happens when I visit Claude.ai..."

**[Show: Button appears on Claude]**

> "The Save Prompt button appears automatically. Now let me visit ChatGPT..."

**[Show: Button on ChatGPT]**

> "Same button, different positioning. And on Gemini..."

**[Show: Sidebar button on Gemini]**

> "It adapts to Gemini's unique interface with a sidebar design."

**[Type ;;]**

> "Now watch the Quick Command feature. I type two semicolons..."

**[Show: Overlay appears]**

> "An overlay appears with all my prompts. But here's the cool part - I can type the prompt name directly."

**[Type ;;code-review]**

> "As I type, it does fuzzy matching and instant insertion. That's live code, not a demo."

**[Screen: Google Sheets backup]**

> "And users can back up their prompts to their own Google Sheet with one click. No OAuth complexity - they create a simple webhook and control their own data."

### Results (30 sec)

**[Screen: Comparison slide]**

> "Traditional development: 40+ hours of coding, research, and debugging. With Claude Code: 6 hours total. That's 85% time savings. But more importantly - I could focus on the user experience and design decisions while Claude Code handled the implementation details."

### Takeaway (30 sec)

**[Screen: Key points]**

> "Claude Code excels at rapid prototyping, research, debugging, and documentation. But you're still in control - you define the vision, make design decisions, and determine when to ship. It's not replacing developers - it's making us dramatically more productive."

### Closing (30 sec)

**[Screen: Resources]**

> "The extension is open source on GitHub - you can see all the code, documentation, and even a guide on how to build your own extension with Claude Code. If you want to try it, just start with 'I want to build...' and let Claude Code help you turn that idea into reality."

**[End]**

## Q&A Prep

### Expected Questions:

**Q: "Did Claude Code write all the code?"**
A: "Claude Code generated about 80% of the code, but I made all the design decisions, tested everything, and refined the user experience. It's pair programming - we collaborated."

**Q: "What about bugs?"**
A: "There were bugs! But debugging with Claude Code was fast. I'd describe the issue, Claude Code would analyze and fix it. The 'extension context invalidated' error? Fixed in 5 minutes."

**Q: "Can non-developers use this?"**
A: "You need some technical knowledge, but Claude Code lowers the barrier significantly. If you understand the concepts and can articulate what you want, Claude Code helps with implementation."

**Q: "What's the catch?"**
A: "You still need to understand what you're building. Claude Code is a powerful tool, but you're the architect. Also, you need to review and test everything - AI can make mistakes."

**Q: "How much does Claude Code cost?"**
A: "Check Claude.com for current pricing. For this project, the cost was minimal compared to the time saved."

**Q: "Would this work for larger projects?"**
A: "This extension is actually non-trivial - 1500+ lines of code, multiple platforms, complex features. For larger projects, you'd break them into phases just like I did."
