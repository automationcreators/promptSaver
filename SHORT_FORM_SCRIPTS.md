# Short-Form Scripts: 7 x 60-Second Clips
## For YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels

### Why 7 Clips?
- **Maximum platform reach:** Each clip targets different timing/audience moment
- **Compound leverage:** Each clip drives traffic back to long-form video
- **Testing:** See which hooks resonate most
- **Content variety:** 2-3 weeks of daily content from one video

### Publishing Strategy
- **Post 3 to TikTok** (space 4-6 hours apart)
- **Post 3 to YouTube Shorts** (daily or every other day)
- **Post 2 to Instagram Reels** (once daily)
- **Include link to full video** in bio, description, or comments (every variation)

### Format for Each Clip
- **Length:** 45-60 seconds (TikTok loves under 60)
- **Opening Hook:** 3-5 seconds (stop scroll)
- **Content:** 40-50 seconds (deliver promise)
- **CTA:** 2-3 seconds (send to main video)
- **Font size:** 18pt minimum (readable on phone)
- **Text overlays:** Key phrases in white or bright yellow

## Clip 1: The Massive Prompt Problem

**Hook (0:00-0:05):**
[SHOW: Massive 500-word prompt on screen, scrolling down rapidly]

**Voiceover:**
"This is what most people write when they start a project."

**Pattern Break (0:05-0:15):**
[SHOW: Simple 3-sentence prompt]

**Voiceover:**
"This is what actually works. See the difference?"

**Body (0:15-0:50):**
[SHOW: Split-screen side-by-side]

**Voiceover:**
"Big prompts make Claude Code generate 2,000 lines of code at once. You can't test it. You don't understand it. It breaks. You blame the tool. Actually, you just shot yourself in the foot.

Small prompts? 50 lines. You test it immediately. You understand every part. Then you add to it. You ship by hour 2.

Start small. Always."

**Text Overlay:**
"START SMALL" (0:15-0:35)
"ONE FEATURE AT A TIME" (0:35-0:50)

**CTA (0:50-0:60):**
[SHOW: Your face on camera]

**Voiceover:**
"I built an entire Chrome extension following this rule. Full breakdown: [link in bio]"

**Text Overlay:**
"WATCH THE FULL VIDEO" (0:50-0:60)

---

## Clip 2: The Code Reading Problem

**Hook (0:00-0:05):**
[SHOW: Screen of code, very fast scrolling]

**Voiceover:**
"Don't do this."

**Pattern Break (0:05-0:10):**
[SHOW: You pointing at code on screen]

**Voiceover:**
"Do this instead."

**Body (0:10-0:50):**
[SHOW: You with code editor visible]

**Voiceover:**
"Claude Code writes code. You see 200 lines generated and think, 'Great, that's done.' You don't read it. You paste it in.

Now it doesn't work. You blame Claude Code. Actually, you have no idea what you pasted.

Here's the move: READ. EVERY. LINE. Ask why it was written that way. If you can't explain it, remove it and see what breaks. Learn as you go.

The moment you understand your code, you own it. You're not dependent anymore."

**Text Overlay:**
"READ FIRST" (0:10-0:30)
"UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY" (0:30-0:50)

**CTA (0:50-0:60):**
[SHOW: Title card]

**Voiceover:**
"Full breakdown with code examples: [link]"

**Text Overlay:**
"LINK IN BIO" (0:50-0:60)

---

## Clip 3: The No-TypeScript Mistake

**Hook (0:00-0:05):**
[SHOW: JavaScript error message on screen, red text]

**Voiceover:**
"This problem haunts JavaScript developers."

**Pattern Break (0:05-0:15):**
[SHOW: TypeScript interface definition]

**Voiceover:**
"This problem doesn't exist in TypeScript."

**Body (0:15-0:50):**
[SHOW: Side-by-side code comparison]

**Voiceover:**
"Without TypeScript, you write code that looks right but doesn't work. The error hides. You debug for 3 hours.

With TypeScript, wrong shape? Instant error. You fix it in 30 seconds.

TypeScript feels slower at first. More boilerplate. But you catch errors earlier. Net result: faster development, less debugging, more shipping.

Don't use JavaScript. Use TypeScript from line 1."

**Text Overlay:**
"TYPESCRIPT FROM START" (0:15-0:35)
"CATCH ERRORS INSTANTLY" (0:35-0:50)

**CTA (0:50-0:60):**
[SHOW: You on camera]

**Voiceover:**
"How I built an entire extension with TypeScript in 8 hours. Full video: [link]"

**Text Overlay:**
"WATCH NOW" (0:50-0:60)

---

## Clip 4: The Testing Problem

**Hook (0:00-0:05):**
[SHOW: Clock at fast speed, time passing]

**Voiceover:**
"Building for hours without testing..."

**Pattern Break (0:05-0:10):**
[SHOW: Build output and success message]

**Voiceover:**
"...then testing and finding 10 bugs."

**Body (0:10-0:50):**
[SHOW: Terminal with build commands]

**Voiceover:**
"Most builders write a feature, then several features, then test everything together. Something breaks. They have no idea which change caused it. Debugging takes forever.

The move: test after every feature. Takes 30 seconds.

```bash
npm run build && npm run type-check
```

Do it after every win. Bug found while it's fresh in your head? Fixed in 2 minutes. Found 3 hours later? Fixed in 30 minutes.

The difference between shipping and giving up."

**Text Overlay:**
"TEST IMMEDIATELY" (0:10-0:30)
"AFTER EVERY FEATURE" (0:30-0:50)

**CTA (0:50-0:60):**
[SHOW: Build success screen]

**Voiceover:**
"See the full workflow: [link in bio]"

**Text Overlay:**
"30-SECOND VALIDATION" (0:50-0:60)

## Clip 5: The Big Commit Problem

**Hook (0:00-0:05):**
[SHOW: Git log with one massive commit (1000+ line changes)]

**Voiceover:**
"This scares me."

**Pattern Break (0:05-0:10):**
[SHOW: Git log with small commits (20-50 lines each)]

**Voiceover:**
"This makes me confident."

**Body (0:10-0:50):**
[SHOW: Both side-by-side]

**Voiceover:**
"Big commits feel dangerous. You don't know what's in them. Something breaks. You can't revert one thing without losing everything else.

Small commits? One feature per commit. You know exactly what each commit does. Something breaks? Revert instantly. You lose 15 minutes of work, not 2 hours.

Here's the rule: if you can't describe your commit in one sentence, it's too big.

One feature = one commit. One commit = confidence."

**Text Overlay:**
"SMALL COMMITS" (0:10-0:30)
"ONE FEATURE PER COMMIT" (0:30-0:50)

**CTA (0:50-0:60):**
[SHOW: You on camera]

**Voiceover:**
"I committed 9 times building this extension. See the breakdown: [link]"

**Text Overlay:**
"COMMIT STRATEGY VIDEO" (0:50-0:60)

## Clip 6: The Platform Misunderstanding Problem

**Hook (0:00-0:05):**
[SHOW: Error messages, confused face emoji]

**Voiceover:**
"Building on a platform you don't understand..."

**Pattern Break (0:05-0:10):**
[SHOW: Architecture diagram, clear layout]

**Voiceover:**
"...versus actually knowing how it works."

**Body (0:10-0:50):**
[SHOW: Architecture diagram and explanations]

**Voiceover:**
"Chrome extensions have security boundaries. Content scripts can't access databases directly. Background workers can't touch the DOM. You don't know this? You build for 2 hours before realizing it's impossible.

The move: spend 15 minutes learning the platform before you write code.

Ask Claude Code: 'Explain Chrome extension architecture and security boundaries.'

Result: 3-minute orientation. You now know the constraints. You can't build anything wrong.

15 minutes of learning saves 2 hours of building the wrong thing."

**Text Overlay:**
"LEARN THE PLATFORM" (0:10-0:30)
"15-MINUTE ORIENTATION" (0:30-0:50)

**CTA (0:50-0:60):**
[SHOW: Title card with your name]

**Voiceover:**
"Full technical breakdown: [link in bio]"

**Text Overlay:**
"ARCHITECTURE GUIDE" (0:50-0:60)

## Clip 7: The Todo List Meta-Pattern

**Hook (0:00-0:05):**
[SHOW: Empty todo list on screen]

**Voiceover:**
"This simple thing changed everything."

**Pattern Break (0:05-0:15):**
[SHOW: Todo list getting checked off, one by one, rapid]

**Voiceover:**
"Watch what happens when you use it."

**Body (0:15-0:50):**
[SHOW: Todo list with timestamps]

**Voiceover:**
"One simple move prevents all 7 mistakes: todo lists. Before you write ANY code, create a list:

Research architecture (15 min)
Build feature 1 (25 min)
Test feature 1 (5 min)
Build feature 2 (25 min)
Test feature 2 (5 min)
... and so on

That's it. Then work through the list.

Each item is a small prompt. One feature per item. You're not overwhelmed. You're shipping by hour 2. You're testing immediately. You're making small commits. You understand everything you built.

This list is your superpower."

**Text Overlay:**
"TODO LIST = CLARITY" (0:15-0:35)
"ONE FEATURE AT A TIME" (0:35-0:50)

**CTA (0:50-0:60):**
[SHOW: You on camera, pointing at camera]

**Voiceover:**
"I'm linking the exact todo list template I used. Grab it, use it, ship something. [link in bio]"

**Text Overlay:**
"TEMPLATE IN BIO" (0:50-0:60)

## Bonus Clip: The "Why Most Quit" Hook

**Hook (0:00-0:05):**
[SHOW: Three people trying to build, then two disappearing]

**Voiceover:**
"I watched three builders try to build a Chrome extension. One shipped. Two quit."

**Body (0:05-0:50):**
[SHOW: Animated text with each mistake appearing]

**Voiceover:**
"The one who shipped didn't make these 7 mistakes:

1. Massive initial prompts
2. Not reading generated code
3. No TypeScript
4. Testing at the end
5. Huge commits
6. Not understanding the platform
7. Shipping too late

Every builder who quit made at least 3 of these. Most made all 7.

The difference wasn't talent. It was knowing what NOT to do.

I just posted the full breakdown. Watch it. Learn it. Don't be builder #2 or #3."

**Text Overlay:**
"7 DEADLY MISTAKES" (0:05-0:30)
"ONLY 1 OF 3 SHIPPED" (0:30-0:50)

**CTA (0:50-0:60):**
[SHOW: Video thumbnail]

**Voiceover:**
"Full video: [link in bio]. Don't quit on your first project."

**Text Overlay:**
"WATCH NOW" (0:50-0:60)

## Performance Tracking for Short-Form

### Metrics to Monitor (Per Clip)
- **Views** (target: 500-1000 per clip by day 3)
- **Engagement rate** (target: 5-8% like ratio)
- **Click-through to main video** (track via UTM parameters)
- **Audience growth** (followers gained per clip)

### What Success Looks Like
- 🟢 Great: 1000+ views, 7%+ engagement, 10+ comments, 50+ clicks to main video
- 🟡 Good: 500+ views, 5%+ engagement, 3+ comments, 25+ clicks to main video
- 🔴 Needs work: <300 views, <3% engagement, 0 comments, <10 clicks

### Optimization Strategy
- If views are low: Hook needs to be punchier, or timing is off
- If engagement is low: Message not resonating with platform audience
- If clicks are low: CTA needs to be clearer or link placement adjusted
- If one clip performs exceptionally: Create 2-3 similar variations
