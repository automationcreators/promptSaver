# YouTube Production Strategy: Prompt Saver Build Series

## 1. Lead Variation Selection

### Recommendation: **Variation 3 (Mistake-Prevention) as Lead Video**

**Strategic Reasoning:**
- Your audience (builders, business owners, automation enthusiasts) responds to **pragmatic, actionable content** over storytelling
- "Don't waste time" messaging creates urgency and psychological investment
- Mistake-prevention positioning establishes you as someone who's "been through it"
- Highest estimated CTR (7-9%) and viral potential
- Creates natural bridge to Variation 1 (full story) as follow-up

**Why NOT lead with Variation 1:**
- Story-first requires more emotional trust with new audience
- Better as video 2 when viewers are already invested
- Works better if posted after initial traction

**Why NOT lead with Variation 2:**
- Too technical for cold audience
- Perfect as deep-dive after they're familiar with the basics
- Better as a "for advanced builders" video later

### Video Release Sequence

**Week 1 - Video 1 (Variation 3): "7 Mistakes That Stop People Building Chrome Extensions"**
- Lead with mistake-prevention angle
- Fast-paced, practical, high value density
- Goal: Hook audience, establish authority, get subscribers

**Week 2 - Video 2 (Variation 1): "How I Built Prompt Saver in 8 Hours (The Real Journey)"**
- Tell the full story for viewers who watched Video 1
- Deeper dive into the actual process
- Create playlist: "Building Tools with Claude Code"
- Goal: Deepen relationship, show authentic process

**Week 3 - Video 3 (Variation 2): "Chrome Extension Architecture: The Systems Thinking Behind Prompt Saver"**
- Technical deep-dive for builders who want to understand the scaffolding
- Most advanced audience at this point
- Goal: Establish technical authority, attract serious builders

- **Aspect Ratio:** 1080p (16:9) for YouTube
- **Frame Rate:** 60fps (smooth code scrolling)
- **Audio:** Clean voice-over with background music (royalty-free)

### Opening (0:00-0:15) — Talking Head Shot
**What to show:**
- You at desk or in casual setting
- Direct eye contact to camera
- Professional but approachable setting

**What to say:**
[Read from Variation 3 Hook]
"I watched three different builders try to build a Chrome extension last month. One shipped a production-quality tool in 8 hours. Two gave up. The difference wasn't coding skill. It was knowing what NOT to do first."

**Technical Setup:**
- Good lighting (key light from 45° angle)
- Quiet room (no background noise)
- Webcam at eye level
- Microphone 6-12 inches away

### Section 1: Mistake #1 (1:00-2:30) — Screen Recording

**Screen to Show:**
1. Massive prompt (500 words) - show in text editor
2. Simple prompt (3 sentences) - show in text editor
3. Split-screen comparison

**Visual Elements:**
- Code font: Size 14+ (readable at 1080p)
- Theme: Dark (less eye strain during long viewing)
- Cursor highlight tool: Enable (show exactly where you're pointing)
- Background: Minimal (no distracting windows)

**What to Do:**
- Type out massive prompt slowly (5 seconds)
- Type out tiny prompt slowly (3 seconds)
- Pause on the comparison (3 seconds)
- Highlight key differences with cursor tool

**What to Say:**
[Read Mistake #1 section from Variation 3]

**Visual Callout Text Overlay:**
"START SMALL" | "ONE FEATURE AT A TIME" | "SHIP EARLY" | "UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY"

### Section 2-7: Remaining Mistakes (2:30-11:30)

**Pattern for Each Mistake:**
1. Show example code or situation (15 seconds)
2. Explain the problem (30 seconds)
3. Show the solution (20 seconds)
4. Explain why it matters (30 seconds)

**Visual Elements for Each:**
- **Mistake #2 (Not reading code):** Show code review checklist on screen
- **Mistake #3 (No types):** Show TypeScript error vs. no-error side-by-side
- **Mistake #4 (Not testing):** Show build output and type-check results
- **Mistake #5 (Not committing small):** Show git log with tiny commits vs. giant commits
- **Mistake #6 (Not understanding platform):** Show architecture diagram
- **Mistake #7 (Not shipping early):** Show timeline: "2 hours = something shippable"

### Section 8: The Todo List Meta-Pattern (11:30-15:00)

**Key Visuals:**
1. Empty todo list on screen
2. Gradually marking items complete during explanation
3. Show the actual Prompt Saver todo list from project
4. Time annotations showing estimated duration per item

**Screen Recording Setup:**

## 3. Screen Recording Technical Setup

### Software Required
- **Screen Recorder:** ScreenFlow (Mac), OBS (cross-platform), or Camtasia
- **Audio:** Use your mic, record separately and sync

- **Graphics:** Canva Pro, Adobe Illustrator, or design elements

### Mac Screen Recording Setup (Recommended)
1. Close all unnecessary applications
2. Set display to 1920x1080 resolution
3. Zoom to 125% in text editor (readable on video)
4. Set Terminal/editor theme to dark mode
5. Open ScreenFlow
6. Select "Record from screen" → "Don't show cursor"
7. Start recording
8. Speak clearly, pause between sections
9. Stop recording after all content

### Recording Checklist
- [ ] Room is quiet (close windows, door)
- [ ] Microphone is charged and positioned
- [ ] Screen is clean (no sensitive files visible)
- [ ] Resolution set to 1920x1080

- [ ] Phone is on silent
- [ ] Recording software tested (do 30-second test first)
- [ ] Audio levels are set correctly (-6dB is ideal)
- [ ] You've read through the script once

### Recording Tips
1. **Do multiple takes:** Record the hook 3-5 times, pick the best
2. **Pause naturally:** Don't talk continuously—add pauses for editing
3. **Speak clearly:** Imagine talking to one person across a table
4. **Point during explanations:** Use cursor highlight to draw attention
5. **Vary pace:** Slow for complex parts, faster for obvious stuff
6. **Spell names:** When mentioning Claude Code features, spell them visually

## 8. Promotion Strategy

### Twitter/X Thread (Post Day 1)
```
I watched 3 builders try to make a Chrome extension.

One shipped production-ready code in 8 hours.
Two gave up.

The difference? Knowing what NOT to do first.

I just posted the 7 biggest mistakes I see—and how to prevent all of them.

[Link to video]

Here's the breakdown:
1. Massive initial prompts (forces bloat)
2. Not reading generated code (creates dependency)
3. No TypeScript from start (hidden bugs)
4. Testing at the end (debugging nightmare)
5. Giant commits (can't revert safely)
6. Ignoring platform constraints (wrong architecture)
7. Shipping too late (lose momentum)

The meta-pattern? Todo lists. Seriously.

Breaking a big project into small tasks changes everything:
- You're not overwhelmed
- You're shipping by hour 2
- You catch bugs early
- You stay motivated

Watch the full breakdown here: [link]
```

### LinkedIn Post (Professional Angle)
```
Building production tools is 90% about preventing mistakes, 10% about writing code.

I just published the 7 biggest mistakes I see when builders tackle Chrome extensions—and the exact moves that prevent them.

The interesting part? These mistakes aren't about coding ability. They're about workflow and architecture thinking.

Video breakdown: [link]

If you're building anything complex (extension, web app, tool), the meta-pattern at the end will change how you think about projects.
```

### YouTube Community Post (Day 1)
```
🚀 NEW VIDEO: 7 Mistakes That Stop Builders

Just uploaded the first in a 3-part series on building with Claude Code.

## 9. Content Performance Tracking

### Metrics to Monitor (First 48 Hours)
- Views (target: 500+ in first 24h)
- Watch time (target: 65-75% average completion rate)
- Click-through rate (target: 6-8%)
- Likes/dislikes ratio
- Comments (both quantity and sentiment)
- Shares

### What Success Looks Like
- **🟢 Great:** 1000+ views in 24h, 70%+ completion, 10+ comments with questions
- **🟡 Good:** 500+ views in 24h, 65%+ completion, 5+ engaged comments
- **🔴 Needs work:** <300 views in 24h, <60% completion, no engagement

### Adjustment Strategy
- If completion rate is low, video may be too long or slow in that section
- If CTR is low, thumbnail or title needs work
- If engagement is low, content may not be addressing pain point
- Use YouTube Analytics to identify drop-off points
