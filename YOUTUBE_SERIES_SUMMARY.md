## Critical Success Factors

### 1. **Start Recording** (Biggest barrier)
- You have the script → Read it once
- You have the setup guide → Follow it
- Record today, not "someday"
- First take is usually best (stop overthinking)

### 2. **Commit to the Series**
- Don't publish Video 1 unless you're ready for Videos 2 & 3
- The 3-video arc is more powerful than standalone videos
- You've already done the planning, just execute

### 3. **Use the Checklists**
- Don't try to remember everything
- Print pre-recording checklist
- Print editing checklist
- Follow step-by-step

### 4. **Ship It**
- "Perfect" video stuck in editing = 0 views
- "Good" video published = 5,000+ views
- Done > Perfect

## Time Investment Summary

| Phase | Time | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Preparation | 2-3 hours | One-time setup |
| Recording V1 | 5-6 hours | Multiple takes, breaks |
| Editing V1 | 4-6 hours | Most time-intensive |
| Publishing V1 | 1 hour | Upload, promote |
| Recording V2 | 5-6 hours | Gets easier, faster |
| Editing V2 | 3-4 hours | Process streamlined |
| Recording V3 | 5-6 hours | Routine by now |
| Editing V3 | 3-4 hours | Well-practiced |

**That's about 1-2 hours per day for a month.** Or you could front-load it: record all 3 in one week, then edit over following 2 weeks.

- Years of experience (this is your first, learn as you go)
- Everything to be perfect (good enough > perfect never shipped)

**You just need:**
- ✅ The script (you have it)
- ✅ 1 hour to read the recording checklist
- ✅ 5-6 hours to record
- ✅ 4-6 hours to edit
- ✅ 1 hour to publish
- ✅ Commitment to finish

**Total: ~12-14 hours of work = 30,000+ views + 200+ subscribers + YouTube authority**

That's an incredible ROI.

## One More Thing

The hardest part isn't recording or editing. It's hitting play on the recording software.

Everything else becomes obvious once you start.

So pick a date this week. Block 2 hours. Set everything up. Record the intro (30 seconds). If it feels good, keep going. If it feels awkward, do another take.

By the time you finish that first take, you'll have momentum. You'll know what the next take looks like. You'll improve faster.

The first video is your learning video. Videos 2 and 3 are your mastery videos.

**Start recording this week.**

You've already done the hard part (planning). Now just execute.
